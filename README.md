# UniversityInventorySystem-
<b>Introduction</b>- 


</n>The Unveristy inventory system is java application developed as a lab assesssment fot ITS105 Programming Fundamental Course. this system helps to mange the university equipment and assests  also allows staff member to register and equipment to be added, assigned and returned.</n>

<b>Project Structure</b>
1. models package(represents system entities)
   Equpiment Represents general equipment and extends InventoryItem.
   StaffMember where staff and stores assigned quipment are represent
   furniture showcase the furniture items.
   labEquipment represnts the laboratory equipment.
   inventoryItem is abstract base class for all inventory items.
2. Exceptions
InventoryException is the base exception class
3. Manager
InventoyManager helps to handle assignement, return, searching and maintenance fee calculations.
InventorReports helps to generate report using loops
4. Main class
   The main class UniversityInventorySystem is main class that runs the application and integrates all components.

   <b> Lesson learned</b>

It was really a wonderful eperience larning this unit with our professor who was always eager to help us and make us understand everthing in detail with real-world experience.
   1.Object oreinted programming
   it helps to learn design with attribute and method also understand to create relationship between classes.
   2. Inheritance and polymorphism
      it is used to abstaract class as base and create subclass such as Equipment,Furniture and LabEquipment.
   3. Exception Hnadling
         it uses try-catch blocks to prevent program crashes.
   4.Project Oraganization
It is helpful when the structure of java project into packages and understand the importance of clean and readable code. 
 
 <b>Conclusion</b>

The University Inventory System covers the course effectively illustrates where the system handles return, assign and object-oriented design.the project handles experience program structure, exceptional handling and object-oriented design.

  Additionally, the project enhanced problem-solving abilities and comprehension of how Java is used to implement real-world systems.All things considered, this assignment reinforced fundamental programming knowledge and offered invaluable practical experience.
